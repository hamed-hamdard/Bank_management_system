#Bank_management_system
We will create this project as group
we are @hamed-hamdard, @alisinahakimzda, and @rezahaidari1. 
Tip- as you know banks may have many branches so its better to use Distributed Database for banks.
*Distributed Database: is a kind of database that logically exists in one place but physically can be in many places distributed by many computers connected to network.
For creating bank database you can use Distributed Database in main branch and install one copy of that in each branches.
