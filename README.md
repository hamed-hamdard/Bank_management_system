Tip- as you know banks may have many brunches so its better to use Distributed Database.
Distributed Database is a kind of database that logically exists in one place but physically can be in many places distributed by many computers connected to network.
For creating bank database you can use Distributed Database in main brunch and install one copy of rhat in each brunches
